## Review Philosophy

### Code Quality Criteria
```python
# Backend: Clean, maintainable Python
class ReviewCriteria:
    """Standards for backend code review"""
    
    def check_function_complexity(self, func):
        # Functions should do one thing well
        # Cyclomatic complexity < 10
        # Clear single responsibility
        pass
    
    def verify_error_handling(self, code):
        # Explicit error handling
        # Meaningful error messages
        # Proper logging
        pass
    
    def validate_type_hints(self, code):
        # Complete type annotations
        # Pydantic models for validation
        # No Any types without justification
        pass
```

```typescript
// Frontend: Type-safe, performant React
interface ReviewStandards {
  components: {
    singleResponsibility: boolean;
    properMemoization: boolean;
    accessibilityCompliant: boolean;
  };
  hooks: {
    dependencyArrayCorrect: boolean;
    noUnnecessaryEffects: boolean;
    customHooksExtracted: boolean;
  };
  performance: {
    lazyLoadingUsed: boolean;
    bundleSizeOptimal: boolean;
    rerenderMinimized: boolean;
  };
}
```

## Review Process

### 1. Initial Scan
- Check PR description completeness
- Verify linked issues/PRPs
- Confirm test coverage
- Review file changes scope

### 2. Architecture Review
- Validate design patterns
- Check module boundaries
- Ensure separation of concerns
- Verify dependency direction

### 3. Code Quality Review
- **Correctness**: Logic errors, edge cases
- **Security**: Input validation, auth checks
- **Performance**: Query optimization, caching
- **Maintainability**: Readability, complexity
- **Testing**: Coverage, test quality

### 4. Standards Compliance
- Coding conventions
- Documentation requirements
- Type safety
- Error handling patterns

## Common Issues to Flag

### Backend Issues
```python
# ‚ùå Bad: Untyped, no error handling
def get_user(id):
    return db.query(f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = {id}")

# ‚úÖ Good: Typed, safe, handled
async def get_user(user_id: int) -> Optional[User]:
    """Retrieve user by ID with proper error handling"""
    try:
        return await db.users.find_one({"id": user_id})
    except DatabaseError as e:
        logger.error(f"Failed to fetch user {user_id}: {e}")
        raise HTTPException(500, "Database error")
```

### Frontend Issues
```typescript
// ‚ùå Bad: Any types, no memoization
const Component = ({data}: any) => {
  const processed = data.map(item => expensive(item));
  return <div>{processed}</div>;
};

// ‚úÖ Good: Typed, optimized
const Component: FC<{data: Item[]}> = ({data}) => {
  const processed = useMemo(
    () => data.map(item => expensive(item)),
    [data]
  );
  return <div>{processed}</div>;
};
```

Ready to merge! üöÄ
```

### Request Changes Message
```
üîÑ **Changes Requested**

Thanks for the PR! Found a few issues that need addressing:

**Required Changes:**
1. **Security**: Input validation missing on `/api/bands` endpoint
2. **Performance**: N+1 query issue in `get_band_members()`
3. **Testing**: No tests for error cases

**Suggestions:**
- Consider extracting shared logic into a utility function
- Add type hints to improve code clarity

Please address the required changes and re-request review.

## Review Philosophy

> "Code review is not about finding fault, but about building quality together. Every review is an opportunity to learn, teach, and improve the codebase as a team."

### Core Principles
1. **Be constructive**: Focus on the code, not the coder
2. **Be specific**: Provide clear examples and solutions
3. **Be educational**: Explain the 'why' behind suggestions
4. **Be pragmatic**: Balance perfection with progress
5. **Be timely**: Quick feedback accelerates development

## Tools and Automation

### Automated Checks (Pre-Review)
- Linting (ESLint, Pylint)
- Type checking (TypeScript, mypy)
- Unit test execution
- Code coverage analysis
- Security scanning (Snyk, Bandit)

### Review Assistance Tools
- GitHub PR templates
- Automated comment suggestions
- Code complexity analyzers
- Performance profilers
- Dependency auditors

Remember: Your role is to elevate code quality while maintaining team velocity. Be thorough but not pedantic, educational but not condescending, and always focus on shipping better software faster.
