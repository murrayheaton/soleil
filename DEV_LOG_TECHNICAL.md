## Session 2 - July 28, 2025

### Google Drive Role-Based Organization System

**Architecture Implementation**: Complete folder organization system with role-based access control

#### Database Schema Extensions

Added three new tables to support folder organization:

1. **user_folders**: Tracks each user's root folder and sync status
   - Links users to their Google Drive folder structures
   - Maintains sync status and error tracking
   - Indexes on user_id, sync_status for performance

2. **user_song_folders**: Individual song folder tracking within user structures
   - Maps song titles to Google Drive folder IDs
   - Tracks file counts by type (charts, audio)
   - Supports incremental updates with needs_update flag

3. **folder_sync_logs**: Comprehensive audit trail for all sync operations
   - Performance metrics (duration, file counts)
   - Error tracking and debugging information
   - Operation categorization (create, update, sync)

#### Core Services Implementation

**FolderOrganizer** (`app/services/folder_organizer.py`):
- Extends GoogleDriveService for consistent API patterns
- Implements role-based file filtering using existing content_parser logic
- Batch operations with rate limiting (max 100 requests per batch)
- Comprehensive error handling with database logging

**FileSynchronizer** (`app/services/file_synchronizer.py`):
- Real-time webhook processing for file change detection
- Async batch synchronization across multiple users
- Intelligent filtering based on user instrument assignments
- Cleanup utilities for stale sync operations

#### API Layer

**Folder Management API** (`app/api/folder_management.py`):
- RESTful endpoints following existing FastAPI patterns
- Background task integration for long-running operations
- Comprehensive error responses with proper HTTP status codes
- Admin-only endpoints for cross-user folder management

**Role Management API** (`app/api/role_management.py`):
- Instrument validation using INSTRUMENT_KEY_MAPPING
- Automatic folder reorganization triggers
- Permission-based access control (users vs admins)
- Real-time sync job scheduling with UUID tracking

#### Key Technical Decisions

1. **Shortcuts over File Copying**: Using Google Drive shortcuts to avoid storage duplication while providing clean organization
2. **Async-First Design**: All operations use asyncio for scalability with large file sets
3. **Database-Backed Tracking**: Every sync operation logged for debugging and monitoring
4. **Modular Service Architecture**: Clear separation between organization, synchronization, and API layers
5. **Existing Pattern Integration**: Leverages established GoogleDriveService and content_parser patterns

#### Files Modified/Created

**New Models**:
- `app/models/folder_structure.py` - Database models and Pydantic schemas

**New Services**:
- `app/services/folder_organizer.py` - Core folder organization logic
- `app/services/file_synchronizer.py` - Real-time synchronization engine

**New APIs**:
- `app/api/folder_management.py` - Folder operations endpoints
- `app/api/role_management.py` - User role and instrument management

**Updated Files**:
- `app/models/user.py` - Added folder relationship and utility methods
- `app/main.py` - Integrated new API routers
- `app/database/migrations/add_folder_structure.py` - Database migration

**Test Coverage**:
- `tests/test_folder_organizer.py` - Comprehensive service tests
- `tests/test_file_synchronizer.py` - Sync operation tests  
- `tests/test_role_management.py` - API endpoint tests

#### Performance Considerations

- Batch API operations stay under Google's 100-request limit
- Database queries use proper indexes for user and folder lookups
- Rate limiting integrated to respect Google Drive API limits (1000/100s)
- Async processing prevents blocking on large sync operations

#### Technical Debt Added

- Authentication system still mocked (get_current_user placeholder)
- Google Drive credentials management needs proper OAuth integration
- Test environment database initialization needs improvement
- Error recovery for failed sync operations could be more sophisticated

### Integration Points for Next Phase

- Ready for Google OAuth integration with existing credential patterns
- Database schema prepared for multi-band scaling
- API endpoints ready for frontend integration
- Webhook infrastructure prepared for real-time updates

## Session 3 - July 30, 2025

### User Prompt-Driven Technical Changes

The following technical implementations were triggered by specific user requests:

1. **Typography Implementation** (User: "you still havent change the 'Live' in 'Sole Power Live' to be a light font weight")
   - Applied `font-thin` class to "Live" text in all locations
   - Used `font-black` for "Sole Power" brand text
   - Updated both login screens and headers

2. **Musical Flat Symbol Spacing** (User: "maybe you need to change the character spacing JUST for those 2 characters")
   - Implemented conditional letter-spacing: `-0.25em` for B♭ and E♭ only
   - Used inline styles: `style={{letterSpacing: '-0.25em'}}`
   - Progressive refinement from -0.1em → -0.15em → -0.2em → -0.25em per user feedback

3. **Color Scheme Desaturation** (User: "the 'Song List' interface is still blue")
   - Replaced all Tailwind blue-tinted grays with explicit hex values
   - Background: `#171717`, Cards: `#262626`, Borders: `#404040`
   - Applied to all buttons, backgrounds, and interactive elements

4. **Guitar Chord Chart Fix** (User: "theyre in there and their called 'Chords'")
   - Updated backend file filtering to check both "chord" and "chords"
   - Modified line 597: `elif chart_type == 'chord' and (chart_suffix.lower() == 'chord' or chart_suffix.lower() == 'chords'):`

5. **Authentication Implementation** (User: "can youi add a sign out button on the nav bar")
   - Added sign out functionality in Layout.tsx with localStorage.clear()
   - Implemented proper session cleanup and redirect to home

6. **Login Screen Positioning** (User: "okay aybe just raise the whole login interface up by half its height")
   - Added `paddingBottom: '25vh'` to login container positioning
   - Applied to both page.tsx and repertoire/page.tsx login screens
