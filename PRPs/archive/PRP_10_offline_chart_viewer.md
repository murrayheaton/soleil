# PRP 10: Offline Chart Viewer

## Overview
Create a comprehensive offline chart viewing system for SOLEil that allows band members to access and interact with their music charts without requiring an internet connection.

## Priority
HIGH - This is a key feature for live performance situations where internet connectivity may be unreliable.

## Background
Musicians often perform in venues with poor or no internet connectivity. Having an offline-capable chart viewer ensures that performances can continue smoothly regardless of network conditions.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. **Offline Storage**
   - Store chart data locally using IndexedDB
   - Implement service workers for offline functionality
   - Cache all necessary assets (fonts, images, styles)
   - Support selective sync for storage management

2. **Chart Display**
   - Render charts in multiple formats (chord charts, lead sheets, lyrics)
   - Support transposition without server calls
   - Enable zoom and pan functionality
   - Implement smooth scrolling for long charts

3. **Synchronization**
   - Sync changes when connection is restored
   - Handle conflict resolution for concurrent edits
   - Show sync status indicators
   - Queue offline changes for later sync

4. **Performance Features**
   - Support setlist mode for sequential chart viewing
   - Implement auto-scroll with adjustable speed
   - Enable quick search across offline charts
   - Support annotations and notes

### Non-Functional Requirements
- Must work on mobile devices (iOS Safari, Chrome)
- Charts must load in <500ms when offline
- Support storage of at least 500 charts
- Battery-efficient implementation

## Technical Approach

### Frontend Components
- Create `OfflineChartViewer` component
- Implement `ChartCache` service for IndexedDB operations
- Build `SyncManager` for handling online/offline transitions
- Design `ChartRenderer` for various display formats

### Backend Support
- Create efficient chart data compression
- Implement delta sync API endpoints
- Build conflict resolution logic
- Design batch download endpoints

### Database Schema
- Add `offline_charts` table for tracking synced charts
- Create `sync_log` table for tracking changes
- Implement versioning system for charts

## Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for all offline storage operations
- Integration tests for sync functionality
- E2E tests simulating offline scenarios
- Performance tests for large chart libraries

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Charts are fully functional without internet connection
2. Changes sync automatically when connection returns
3. No data loss during offline/online transitions
4. Performance remains smooth with 500+ charts cached
5. Clear indicators show offline/online status

## Dependencies
- Previous completion of basic chart management system
- Google Drive integration for initial chart import
- Authentication system for user-specific charts

## Estimated Effort
- Frontend Development: 3 days
- Backend Development: 2 days
- Testing: 2 days
- Documentation: 1 day

## Success Metrics
- 100% chart availability when offline
- <500ms load time for cached charts
- Zero data loss during sync operations
- 95% user satisfaction with offline experience
