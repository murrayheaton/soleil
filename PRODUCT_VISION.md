# SOLEil - Your Band, Organized

## What is SOLEil?

SOLEil (Sole Power Live) is a modern web app that makes managing band charts, setlists, and gig information effortless. Think of it as your band's digital music folder that's always organized, always accessible, and always up-to-date.

## Who It's For

- **Musicians** who are tired of digging through email attachments for charts
- **Band Leaders** who want to stop being the "chart police" at every gig
- **Music Directors** who need everyone on the same page (literally)

## The SOLEil Experience

Imagine you're a trumpet player. You get a gig notification on your phone. You tap it, and there's everything you need: the setlist, your B♭ charts, the venue address, and even recordings to practice with. No emails, no "hey, can you send me that chart again?" - just music, ready when you are.

## Current Features

### Complete Platform Experience ✅
**Fully Functional**: Musicians have a complete, production-ready platform with professional UI and seamless authentication.

- **Google Authentication**: One-click sign-in with your Google account - no passwords to remember

- **Professional Interface**: Clean, musical typography with proper flat symbols (B♭, E♭) and elegant spacing
- **Mobile-Ready Design**: Works perfectly on phones, tablets, and desktops with responsive touch targets

### Smart File Organization ✅
