## Session 5 - August 3, 2025

### New User Onboarding Flow Implementation

**User Request**: "okay lets use the execution instructions to execute the prp starting with 3"

#### What Was Accomplished

- **ProfileOnboarding Component**: Created a beautiful welcoming interface with gradient header and clear instructions for new users
- **Smart New User Detection**: Backend now detects first-time users during Google OAuth callback and redirects them appropriately
- **Pre-filled Forms**: The onboarding form automatically pulls in the user's name and email from their Google account
- **Session API Endpoint**: Added `/api/auth/session` to retrieve current user's Google data for the frontend
- **Instrument Selection**: Comprehensive dropdown with all instruments including proper transposition notation (B‚ô≠, E‚ô≠, etc.)
- **Technical Fixes**: Resolved useSearchParams error by wrapping component in Suspense boundary

#### User Impact

New musicians joining SOLEil now have a delightful first experience. Instead of seeing a broken profile page with endless loading spinners, they're greeted with a warm welcome message and a simple form to set up their profile. The form is already filled with their name from Google, they just need to select their instrument and they're ready to access their music. This change transforms a frustrating broken experience into a smooth, professional onboarding flow.

### Root Page Redirect and API Consistency Fix

**User Request**: "using the framework in /Users/murrayheaton/Documents/GitHub/soleil/.claude/execute-soleil-prp.md can you implement 02_fix_root_redirect_and_api_endpoints.md"

#### What Was Accomplished

- **Immediate Authentication Check**: Root page now immediately redirects unauthenticated users to login without delays or retries
- **New User Experience**: Added a welcoming message for first-time users on the profile page
- **Simplified Code**: Removed complex retry logic that was causing confusion and delays

#### User Impact

Musicians visiting solepower.live now experience instant redirects - no more loading spinners or retry attempts. New users see a friendly welcome message guiding them to set up their profile, while returning users go straight to their dashboard. The platform feels faster and more responsive.

### Login Page Cleanup

**User Request**: "can you build a prp that fixes a few front end issues... we need to get rid of the button that says test button responsiveness on the login page, and we also need to get rid of the tag line"

#### What Was Accomplished

- **Removed Debug Elements**: Cleaned up the login page by removing temporary debug features that were added during OAuth troubleshooting
- **Professional Login Experience**: The login page now shows only essential elements - the SOLEil logo, Google sign-in button, and powered by footer
- **Maintained Functionality**: All authentication features continue working perfectly while removing user-facing debug information

#### User Impact

The login page now presents a clean, professional first impression for musicians accessing the platform. No more confusing debug buttons or technical messages - just a straightforward path to sign in and access their music.

- **Automatic Sync**: Files added to the band's main Google Drive folder automatically appear in each musician's organized view within 30 seconds
- **Role-Based Access**: Trumpet players see Bb charts, saxophone players see Eb charts, rhythm section sees concert pitch - no more digging through irrelevant files
- **Real-Time Updates**: When musicians change instruments or roles, their folders reorganize automatically

#### User Impact

This solves the core problem band members face: finding their relevant charts among hundreds of files. Instead of manually searching through "Song Title - Eb Alto Sax.pdf" when you play trumpet, musicians now see a clean folder structure organized by song, containing only the files they can actually use.

For example, a trumpet player will see:
```
üìÅ [User]'s Files
  üìÅ Blue Moon
    üìÑ Bb Chart.pdf
    üéµ Blue Moon - Reference.mp3
  üìÅ Fly Me to the Moon  
    üìÑ Bb Chart.pdf
    üéµ Fly Me to the Moon - Demo.mp3
```

#### Technical Foundation

The system includes comprehensive database tracking, error handling, and audit logs to ensure reliable operation even with large file volumes and multiple concurrent users.
