## Session 7 - August 5, 2025

### Modular Architecture Implementation Complete

**User Request**: "using execute-soleil-prp, lets do the next prp in the folder" (referring to PRP 08: Implement Module Integration and Cleanup)

#### What Was Accomplished

- **Enhanced EventBus**: Updated to support source module tracking and target module subscriptions for better debugging and monitoring
- **API Gateway Improvements**: Added health checks, service discovery, and module dependency validation
- **Module Communication Examples**: Created comprehensive examples showing auth→drive, content→sync, and sync→frontend patterns
- **Module Configuration System**: Implemented base configuration classes with environment-specific settings for each module
- **Agent Development Tools**: Created scripts for generating module context and validating module structure
- **Module Versioning**: Added semantic versioning to all MODULE.md files with compatibility matrix
- **Integration Tests**: Created test suites for authentication flow, content sync, and module boundaries
- **Module Dashboard API**: Added `/api/modules` endpoints for monitoring module health and status
- **Documentation Updates**: Created MODULES.md overview, AGENT_GUIDE.md for AI developers, and updated all project docs

#### User Impact

Musicians benefit from:
- **More Reliable System**: Module health checks ensure issues are caught early
- **Faster Updates**: Independent module deployment means fixes can be rolled out quickly
- **Better Performance**: Event-based communication reduces system coupling and improves responsiveness

### Modular Architecture Planning and Documentation Update

**User Request**: "Can you take a look through the route folder in Soleil and determine the function of each documentation marked down and spec and Dave log and update them to reflect the new architecture that we're about to implement in the rebuild"

#### What Was Accomplished

- **Documentation Audit**: Reviewed all documentation files to ensure consistency with the modular architecture plans
- **PLANNING.md Update**: Added detailed modular architecture section showing the transition from monolithic to modular structure
- **PRODUCT_VISION.md Enhancement**: Added technical architecture evolution section explaining the benefits for developers and musicians
- **Module Structure Definition**: Documented the standard module pattern with MODULE.md files for AI agent context
- **Migration Strategy**: Outlined the phased approach to migrate without breaking existing functionality

#### User Impact

While musicians won't see immediate changes, this architectural evolution sets the foundation for:
- Faster feature development as multiple developers can work in parallel
- More reliable updates with module-specific testing
- Better performance as modules can be optimized independently
- Future features like offline mode and real-time collaboration

The modular architecture ensures SOLEil can grow with bands' needs while maintaining the simple, elegant experience musicians love.

### Comprehensive Debugging Pass

**User Request**: "can you do a debugging pass"

#### What Was Accomplished

- **TypeScript Type Safety**: Added missing interfaces for Audio, Chart, and Setlist types
- **Memory Leak Fixes**: Fixed circular dependencies in useEffect hooks, particularly in AudioPlayer and ChartViewer
- **Error Boundaries**: Created global error boundaries for better error handling and user experience
- **Backend Error Handling**: Fixed bare except clauses to catch specific exceptions
- **Authentication Edge Cases**: Ensured proper 401 error handling throughout the application
- **Build Configuration**: Separated test TypeScript config to avoid jest type conflicts with production build

#### User Impact

Musicians now experience:
- More stable application with fewer crashes thanks to error boundaries
- Better performance due to fixed memory leaks
- Clearer error messages when something goes wrong
- Automatic redirects to login when authentication expires
- Overall more reliable and polished experience

## Session 5 - August 3, 2025

- **Mock Infrastructure**: Created comprehensive mocks for Google Drive API and authentication services
- **Coverage Improvement**: Added tests for error handling, edge cases, and integration scenarios
- **Test Utilities**: Built helper functions for common test patterns
- **CI/CD Ready**: Structured tests to run efficiently in continuous integration pipelines

#### User Impact

Musicians benefit from:
- More reliable releases with fewer bugs
- Faster bug fixes when issues are reported
- Confidence that new features won't break existing functionality
- Better overall application stability

## Session 4 - July 31, 2025

### Major Authentication Fix and Modular Architecture Migration

**User Request**: "It's saying I don't have a verified account, but I just did the whole authentication flow"

**Key Discovery**: The authentication system was split across multiple files with complex session management that was causing state synchronization issues.

#### What Was Accomplished

1. **Unified Authentication Service**: Consolidated all auth logic from 5 different files into cohesive service modules
2. **Modular Migration**: Successfully migrated auth functionality to the new modular architecture
3. **Session Management Fix**: Implemented proper session state tracking that persists across page refreshes
4. **Token Handling**: Fixed token refresh logic to prevent authentication loops
