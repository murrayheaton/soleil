# SOLEil Documentation Index

## Documentation System Overview

All project documentation follows a chronological format with dated entries and user prompt references. This index tracks all documentation versions and major milestones.

## Active Documentation Files

### Core Development Logs
- **DEV_LOG.md** - Human-readable development progress with user prompt references
- **DEV_LOG_TECHNICAL.md** - Technical implementation details linked to user requests
- **TASK.md** - Task tracking with completion dates

### Project Documentation
- **PRODUCT_VISION.md** - Current product vision and features
- **PLANNING.md** - Project architecture and structure
- **CLAUDE.md** - AI assistant rules and documentation standards

## Documentation Versions (Snapshots)

### July 30, 2025 - Production Ready Platform

  - Last user request: "okay aybe just raise the whole login interface up by half its height"

## Documentation Rules

1. **Chronological Format**: All entries must be dated with new content appended, never overwritten
2. **User Prompt References**: Every change must reference the specific user request that triggered it
3. **Version Snapshots**: Create dated versions at major milestones
4. **No Overwrites**: Previous entries must be preserved for historical context
5. **Update Frequency**: Documentation must be updated after every 15 user prompts OR when implementation is complete
6. **Exception Handling**: Changes that don't align with user requests can be removed from logs with user permission

## User Prompt Tracking

All development changes are driven by specific user requests. Key examples from July 30, 2025:

1. **Typography**: "you still havent change the 'Live' in 'Sole Power Live' to be a light font weight"
2. **Musical Notation**: "maybe you need to change the character spacing JUST for those 2 characters"
3. **Color Scheme**: "the 'Song List' interface is still blue"
4. **Authentication**: "can youi add a sign out button on the nav bar"
5. **Backend Fix**: "theyre in there and their called 'Chords'"

## How to Use This System

1. **For New Work**: Always append to existing logs with dated entries
2. **For References**: Quote specific user prompts that triggered changes
3. **For Milestones**: Create dated snapshot versions of key documents
4. **For Context**: Read chronologically to understand project evolution
