To host the application at your own domain you’d deploy the backend (FastAPI), frontend (Next.js), and supporting services (PostgreSQL, Redis, Celery, etc.) using the provided Docker setup.

Key references from the repository:

* The root README explains how to configure the backend and frontend and how to start the stack with Docker Compose
* The frontend README suggests deploying the Next.js app using Vercel and outlines environment variable setup
* The Docker Compose file includes a production-oriented Nginx reverse proxy service mapping ports 80/443 and mounting Nginx configuration files

### Typical steps
1. **Provision a server or hosting platform**
   - Choose a VPS or cloud provider capable of running Docker (e.g., AWS EC2, DigitalOcean).
   - Install Docker and Docker Compose on that server.

2. **Clone the repository and configure environment variables**
   - From the root directory run the setup steps in `README.md` to create `.env` for the backend and `.env.local` for the frontend.
   - Update variables like `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_WS_URL`, and the Google OAuth settings to use your domain instead of `localhost`.

3. **Update OAuth redirect URIs and domain settings**
   - In your Google Cloud console set the OAuth redirect URI to `https://<your-domain>/api/auth/google/callback`.
   - Ensure the backend `.env` contains that same callback URL.

4. **Configure Nginx and SSL**
   - The `docker-compose.yml` references volumes `./nginx/nginx.conf` and `./nginx/ssl`. Provide an `nginx.conf` that proxies requests to the frontend (port 3000) and backend (port 8000), and place SSL certificates (e.g., from Let’s Encrypt) in `nginx/ssl`.

5. **Start the stack**
   - Run `docker-compose up -d` (optionally with the `production` profile) from the project root to build and launch the services—PostgreSQL, Redis, backend, frontend, Celery workers, and Nginx.

6. **Point your domain to the server**
   - Update your DNS records so your domain points to the server’s IP. Once DNS propagates, Nginx will serve the app over HTTP/HTTPS on that domain.

7. **Optional: deploy frontend on Vercel**
   - Instead of self-hosting the Next.js frontend, you could deploy it on Vercel using their instructions from `band-platform/frontend/README.md`. You’d still need to host the backend and database somewhere accessible.
